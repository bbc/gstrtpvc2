Gstreamer RTP Payloader and Depayloader for VC-2
================================================

This repository contains a gstreamer plugin which implements the internet draft
draft-weaver-payload-rtp-vc2hq-00 which specifies a mechanism for the transport
of VC-2 video in RTP.

The two elements included are:
  o rtpvc2pay -- a payloader which takes in VC-2 video and outputs RTP packets
and
  o rtpvc2depay -- a depayloader which reverses this process.

A test pipleine such as 

  filesrc location="input.vc2" ! typefind ! rtpvc2pay ! rtpvc2depay ! filesink location="output.vc2"

will load an input vc2 file and output an exact byte-for-byte duplicate of it.


For a more full test two machines are required, with the transmitter running:

  multifilesrc loop=TRUE location="input.vc2" ! typefind ! rtpvc2pay ! udpsink host=<RX_IP> port=5555

which will print the caps for the RTP stream as well as starting the transmission.

The receiver should run:

 udpsrc port=5555 caps="<CAPS_FROM_TX>" ! queue ! rtpvc2depay ! filesink location="output.vc2"
